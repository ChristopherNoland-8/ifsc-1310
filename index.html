  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>What web accessibility means to me essentially is that <strong>anyone</strong> can use the website no matter who they are.
  That doesn't necessarily mean that I, as the creator of the website, add in an option for every different accessibility need but rather I could add 
some of the required means to use my website but then make it so my code is overwritable in order for others to add what they need to the website. This 
would make it much easier then having to think of every single need people may have, since there are so many that some would inevitably be forgotten, and implementing them 
sine even then some of the accessibility settings may not actually by what a specific user needed. This helps demonstrate that accessibility is more then just being able to 
operate the website with a keyboard rather then a mouse but it also includes visual aid, auditory aid and maybe in future cases haptic feedback, showing the 
wide span of accessibility options.</p>
<p>The reason I think that is important to build an accessible website is partially because it is a demonstration that you can build an effective and successful website. If
  your website can't be used by everyone, that means it isn't getting the traffic that you were hired to create which shows that you cannot perform your job to the fullest extent.
  But that isn't the only reason why accessibility is important. It is also important because a large portion of users suffer some kind of impairment or disability, and if 
  accessibility isn't included into the website than that is leading to an exclusion of a large amount people who don't deserve that exclusion, purposeful or not.

<h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>As I understood it, progressive enhancement is essentially putting more thought and effort into the content first and foremost, then focusing on design and function after.
  It is very similar to the mindset that the content is the most important aspect of a website. The imporantance of progressive enhancement as far as I can tell is that it appeases everyone.
  There is a time put into content, css, and javascript so that everyone is accounted for within the website which in a sense ties into web accessibility, making sure everyone is catered to. This
  is imporant in web design since your consumers are who you are supposed to cater too, no matter what aspect of the website they come back for.
