  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>What web accessibility means to me essentially is that <strong>anyone</strong> can use the website no matter who they are.
  That doesn't necessarily mean that I, as the creator of the website, add in an option for every different accessibility need but rather I could add 
some of the required means to use my website but then make it so my code is overwritable in order for others to add what they need to the website. This 
would make it much easier then having to think of every single need people may have, since there are so many that some would inevitably be forgotten, and implementing them 
sine even then some of the accessibility settings may not actually by what a specific user needed. This helps demonstrate that accessibility is more then just being able to 
operate the website with a keyboard rather then a mouse but it also includes visual aid, auditory aid and maybe in future cases haptic feedback, showing the 
wide span of accessibility options.</p>
<p>The reason I think that is important to build an accessible website is partially because it is a demonstration that you can build an effective and successful website. If
  your website can't be used by everyone, that means it isn't getting the traffic that you were hired to create which shows that you cannot perform your job to the fullest extent.
  But that isn't the only reason why accessibility is important. It is also important because a large portion of users suffer some kind of impairment or disability, and if 
  accessibility isn't included into the website than that is leading to an exclusion of a large amount people who don't deserve that exclusion, purposeful or not.
